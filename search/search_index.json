Their content is not at all tabular in nature. Layout tables should not be used in HTML5. They can introduce reading and navigation order issues. Screen readers may interpret them as data tables (i.e., announcing column and row numbers), especially if they contain table header (``) cells. This introduces significant overhead on screen reader users. &gt; ### What To Do &gt; In almost every case, layout tables can be replaced with other HTML elements and styled with CSS to achieve the desired visual presentation. If the table contains tabular data, provide appropriate header (``) cells. If the layout table remains, verify that the reading and navigation order of table content (based on underlying source code order) is logical and give it role=\"presentation\" to ensure it is not identified as a table to screen reader users. &gt; ### The Algorithm... in English &gt; A `` element is present that does not contain any header (``) cells. &gt; ### Standards and Guidelines &gt; - [1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc1.3.1) &gt; - [1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence (Level A)](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc1.3.2)"},{"location":"known-issues-and-solutions/solutions-index/alert-layout-table/#example-of-a-dom-snippet-generated-from-wave-tool","title":"Example of a DOM Snippet Generated From WAVE Tool","text":"<pre><code>[HTML snippet showing the problematic code structure that WAVE detected]\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"known-issues-and-solutions/solutions-index/alert-layout-table/#project-team-error-guidance","title":"Project Team Error guidance","text":"<p>The following material covers how the Project Team has provided a solution to the [Error] WAVE error.</p>"},{"location":"known-issues-and-solutions/solutions-index/alert-layout-table/#project-page-details","title":"Project Page Details","text":"<ul> <li>Project Page name: [INSERT PAGE NAME or \"ALL\"]</li> <li>Project Staging URL: [INSERT URL or \"N/A\"]</li> <li>Requires sign in: [TRUE OR FALSE]</li> <li>Required User Role: [INSERT ONE OF: Visitor, Logged in user, Admin, Security Admin]</li> <li>Can access page directly from URL: [TRUE OR FALSE]</li> <li>Accepts URL parameters: [TRUE OR FALSE]</li> </ul>"},{"location":"known-issues-and-solutions/solutions-index/alert-layout-table/#project-team-issue-and-pr-details","title":"Project Team Issue and PR details","text":"<ul> <li>Related GitHub Issue(s):</li> <li>[INSERT ISSUE URL]</li> <li>Related Pull Request(s):</li> <li>[INSERT PR URL]</li> <li>React Component(s)</li> <li>[INSERT PATH: e.g. path/to/Component.jsx]</li> </ul>"},{"location":"known-issues-and-solutions/solutions-index/alert-layout-table/#project-team-solution","title":"Project Team Solution","text":""},{"location":"known-issues-and-solutions/solutions-index/alert-layout-table/#what-is-the-specific-problem-that-was-occurring","title":"What is the specific problem that was occurring?","text":"<p>[INSERT CONTENT]</p>"},{"location":"known-issues-and-solutions/solutions-index/alert-layout-table/#what-is-the-proposed-solution-to-this-problem","title":"What is the proposed solution to this problem?","text":"<p>[INSERT CONTENT]</p>"},{"location":"known-issues-and-solutions/solutions-index/alert-layout-table/#step-by-step-guide","title":"Step-By-Step Guide","text":"Click to see step-by-step guide <p>  [ADD DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS HERE]  </p>"},{"location":"known-issues-and-solutions/solutions-index/alert-layout-table/#other-technical-details","title":"Other Technical Details","text":"Click to see other technical details <p>  [ INSERT OTHER DETAILS e.g. Prop References, Return Value ]  </p>"},{"location":"known-issues-and-solutions/solutions-index/alert-layout-table/#code-snippet-with-solution","title":"Code Snippet With Solution","text":"Click to see code snippets...
