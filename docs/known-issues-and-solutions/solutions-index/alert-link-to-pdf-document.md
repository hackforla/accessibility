### WAVE Category
Alerts
### WAVE Error
Link to PDF document
### What It Means
A link to a PDF document is present.
### Why It Matters
Unless authored with accessibility in mind, PDF documents often have accessibility issues. Additionally, PDF documents are typically viewed using a separate application or plug-in, and can thus cause confusion and navigation difficulties.
### What To Do
Ensure the PDF document is natively accessible. Additionally, inform the user that the link will open a PDF document. Because PDF documents may have limitations in accessibility (particularly for complex content) and require a separate program, HTML content should often be used in place of or in addition to the PDF document.
### The Algorithm... in English
A link to a .pdf file is present.
### Standards and Guidelines
None
